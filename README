'gitmirror' provides a wrapper script around `git`, which in case of `git clone` uses a local mirror to clone from.

# Setup

Clone this repository and create a symlink to 'gitmirror/git' in '$HOME/bin', or in any other part of your '$PATH' which might suite your needs.

# Usage

Just as you would normaly call `git`.

# Tests

To test edge and corner cases, there are test under 'tests/'. Please send feedback if you found a bug!
