'gitmirror' provides a wrapper script around `git`, which in case of `git clone` uses a local mirror to clone from.

# Setup

Clone this repository and create a symlink from '$HOME/bin/git' to 'gitmirror/git', or in any other part of your '$PATH' which might suite your needs.

# Usage

Just as you would normaly call `git`.

# Tests

To test edge and corner cases, there are some tests under 'tests/'. Please send feedback if you found a bug!

# Debugging

```
# ed@ohsumi [ohsumi]:~/tmp/kalua/build-env [refs/heads/bernd|*] $
script -t=timingfile -c "rm -rf openwrt packages; ./build.sh --openwrt trunk; cd openwrt; ../build.sh --openwrt trunk --hardware 'TP-LINK TL-WDR3600' --usecase 'OpenWrt'" typescript
less -r typescript
```
